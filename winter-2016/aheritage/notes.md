This course is designed to look at moral issues with politics, history, and economics. To remind ourselves of what our responsibilities are to each other. "How do you build a good society?"

We want to reach back and find what was useful in the past and try to reconnect to it.

1841 slave ship taken over by slaves. They're taken to New York and go to the supreme court represented by John Quincy Adams. He argues that the natural state of man is freedom. "Who we are is who we were." We value individualism, but we are part of a wider whole.

Mr. Smith Goes to Washington: 5 & 7:30pm on Jan 20th in 140 JSB

Major Themes of the class:
 - American "expectationalism". Americans have created high expectations with the constitution and such. How did we measure up to those ideas or goals?
 - art and power of the community through the social contract. The power by which we've created the rules of our community. What we expect of the governement, what they expect of us.
 - in medias res ... in the middle of things. When you just jump into story. Founding should be present tense. A founding is a process that keeps going.

Human predicament:
 - Tyranny
 - Revolution
 - Anarchy
 - Competing Groups

In the United States we are attempting to step out of the human predicament.

After a tyrant is overthrown it creates a power vacuum and leads to anarchy.

Tyranny is the rule of will.

How can we get out of the cycle (human predicament)?
 - A self-conscious attempt to avoid tyranny & anarchy
 - Benefits society as a whole
 - balance between liberty and order
 - "goods of the soul": dignity, respect, feeling like you matter
