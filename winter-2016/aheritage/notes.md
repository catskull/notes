This course is designed to look at moral issues with politics, history, and economics. To remind ourselves of what our responsibilities are to each other. "How do you build a good society?"

We want to reach back and find what was useful in the past and try to reconnect to it.

1841 slave ship taken over by slaves. They're taken to New York and go to the supreme court represented by John Quincy Adams. He argues that the natural state of man is freedom. "Who we are is who we were." We value individualism, but we are part of a wider whole.

## Wednesday, January 6th

Mr. Smith Goes to Washington: 5 & 7:30pm on Jan 20th in 140 JSB

Major Themes of the class:
 - American "expectationalism". Americans have created high expectations with the constitution and such. How did we measure up to those ideas or goals?
 - art and power of the community through the social contract. The power by which we've created the rules of our community. What we expect of the governement, what they expect of us.
 - in medias res ... in the middle of things. When you just jump into story. Founding should be present tense. A founding is a process that keeps going.

Human predicament:
 - Tyranny
 - Revolution
 - Anarchy
 - Competing Groups

In the United States we are attempting to step out of the human predicament.

After a tyrant is overthrown it creates a power vacuum and leads to anarchy.

Tyranny is the rule of will.

How can we get out of the cycle (human predicament)?
 - A self-conscious attempt to avoid tyranny & anarchy
 - Benefits society as a whole
 - balance between liberty and order
 - "goods of the soul": dignity, respect, feeling like you matter
 - 
 
## Athenian Idea of Virtue

Sought human excellence (arete) in all things, enhanced by proper education.

Plato's cardinal personal virtues:
 - wisdom
 - temperance
 - courage
 - justice

Plato thought if you could make citizens excellent, they would make a good city, and a good city provides what the next generation needs to have good people, and they would in turn improve the city.

## Ancient Christian Virtues

 ex. faith, meekness, humility, kindness, etc.

Those virtues are designed to teach you proper behavior, internally, by changing your heart so you desire to be better. That in turn changes your outward behavior.

In a Christian society, you would seek fairness, and to serve your neighbors.

Problems with Christian virtue:
 - People can take it too far. You can become overzealous.
 - Christians can be too submissive, tune out of society. They're only worried about salvation, not so much making society better.

## Enlightenment Virtue (16, 17, 18th century societies, primarily western europe)

 - Humans act out of self-interest. People do what makes them happy regardless of overall society.
 - Virtue is great, but not reliable
 - Enlightenment thinkers believed what they observed around them
 - People don't inherently care about virtue.

## The Virtues & Vices of Self-Interest
 - it's reliable. If you see $10 on the ground, you'll pick it up.
 - Often people's interests induce cooperation. Aligns self-interest.
 - Other times degenerates into selfishness, self-deception, and narcissism.

Video clip: Mr. Roger's opening song.
 - That show was virtuous.

Video clip: kids dividing candy
 - Kids are asked to take a fair share of candy, and they want to take all of it.
 - They rationalize taking all the candy as fair.

## By the power of self-interest

### Structure:
 - rules and processes designed to promote viruous behavior
 - in government we make structures to do that.

### Counterpoise:
 - balancing one persons' self-interest against another's in a formal, structured relationship

We need both virtue and self-interest for a good society.


## The American Inheritance

Show me the money or show me the way? Both?

Double helix - one strand is Puritan, one is Virginia. They are both needed. We tend to focus more on puritans, but the virginia settlement is just as important.

Video clip: Founding of Jamestown. Disease, hostile indians, spanish spies. Many died.

## The Story at Jamestown

1607, other attempts to settle previously.

Desire to settle jamestown:
 - money. They wanted to improve their lot in life. That's what drives them.j
 - business proposition. Joint-stock operation. You could buy stock in it and hopefully make money.
 - Adventureres: financial risk takers, venture capitalists. Some members of royalty. They did not come to the colony they stayed home. Simply investors.
 - Planters: the leaders of the virginia colony. They actually came across. Many of them are second sons, well off families but didn't have an inheritance. Looking to make their way in life, that was harder to do in England. They become the governing bodies. Natural leaders.
 - Indentured Servants: Less well off than planters. Might have been kicked off land, might be urban dwellers. They contracted with a planter who would pay their passage over and room and board for X number of years, then would be free and would get some land (10, 50 acres). Usually contracted between 4 and 7 years. Much better opportunity than in England.

## Starvation and Salvation

They were ill prepared. Virtually no skills.

Way too many "gentlemen" (about 1/3 of the settlers). Gentlemen did no work, they couldn't work or didn't know how.

They land in a bad spot, no clean water and full of mosquitos.

They did bring a goldsmith, a perfumer, a mason, a couple carpenters.

High mortality rate (80%).

1609 John Smith takes charge. He forces them to work 4 hours a day to eat.

Winter of 1609 only 90 survived.

Eventually saved by tobacco and John Rolfe.

John Rolfe was shipwreked in bermuda and brought tobacco seeds to jamestown. Tobacco becomes extremely popular in england and is valueble. Tobacco becomes a currency in Jamestown.

Jamestown is a total failure. Eventually the crown takes over.

Rolfe takes Pocahontus to England where she becomes a celebrity.

## Jamestown Inheritance

Race based slavery. Indentured servitude didn't work that well, so slavery took it's place.

Created a fierce love of personal liberty. Many people were pretty much on their own so they governed themselves.

Self-government & House of Burgesses

## Mr. Winthrop in the House (Puritans in New England)

John Winthrop isn't a member of the settler group, but he's a respected person and says America will be different, and example to the world, a "city upon a hill".

Puritans are like pilgrims, but not the pilgrims.

Puritans wanted to take the church back to what it was supposed to be.

Mean sailor died, they took it to mean that God had smitten him and that justified their own position.

## Calvanism and the Christian Calling

5 finger test:
 - God is in charge.
 - Depravitiy of humans. Humans are horrible by birth and nature, so they must work hard to redeem themselves.
 - Predestination. You never knew which camp you were in.
 - Limited atonement. Chirst only atoned for those that were saved.
 - Perserverence of the elect.

### Puritan Inheritance:

Strong sense of "covenant" communitites

"city upon a hill" is a divinely ordained project

belief in universal and fundimental truth

moral self-governance
