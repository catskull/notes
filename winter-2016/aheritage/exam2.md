# Exam 2 Lectures

## The indispensable One (Myth of George Washington)

Where does the myth come from? Weem's The Life of Washington (80 editions)

Weem had previously written how-to manuals, so Washington's biography becomes a how-to manual for citizens.

Cincinnatus: leaves his plow, directs army to victory, goes back to his plow. A hero to the founders. A republican hero, willing to sacrifice for the commonwealth.

Washington becomes an american Cincinnatus.

Story of cherry tree gets serialized in McGuffey readers, and from there it's stuck.

## The Man Behind the Myth
 - Big guys (6'2" - 6'4"), full foot taller than James Madison. Strong. Recognized as the best horseman in Virginia (big deal).	Commanding presence. Rather vane, he wanted to look good all the time. Complained his clothes never fit properly and he really cared about that.
 - Upper middle class, by his late 20's marries a widow (rich) and gets pretty rich. Tons of land, many plantations. Few hundered slaves.
 - World figure at age 25.
 - Wasn't very learned. Didn't really go to school, educated himself. Always felt he wasn't equal to other founders.
 - Volcanic temper. If you crossed him and he lost it, he'd go after you. He tried to keep it in, but couldn't always.
 - Popular in Virginia, house of Burgess. Gets elected as a deligate.
 - Shows up to contintal congress in full military uniform and volunteers to be general. Not unanimously selected, but he was the obvious choice.

## The Travails of Washington
 - Had to build an army from ground zero. Difficult to get soldiers, difficult to keep soldiers.
 - Problems with Congress. Lots of fighting between state deligates. Always writing congress for money and supplies.
 - Other competing generals.
 - Temporary enlistments (soldiers). Soldiers from different states varied greatly in the enlistment time. Some as short as 6 weeks. Typical was 3 months, 6 months was a long time. Constantly training recruits. Gets better over war time, but never completely solved.
 - Uncertain supply chain. Most merchants preferred to trade with the British since British money was circulated. Had to buy inferior material. Couldn't get what he needed.
 - Unprepared army.

## How Did He Do It?

Military
 - Changed the rules of war. Sort of goes "geurilla". Couldn't compete in large battles, so he turns to short quick fights. Get in get out. He doesn't have to win, he just has to survive. Eventually British will get sick of paying for the war.
 - Better training.
 - Revered by soldiers, he treated them fairly. He stayed with them at all times, same conditions as soldiers.
 - Washington's style of warfare is used by all kinds of revolutionary wars, even still today.

Politically
 - Undnerrated. He had been a politician elected several times. He knew people and politics. He knew power.
 - Experienced and street smart. Social standing.
 - He was able to keep tabs on rival generals.
 - Held the confidence of the people. Not just his army, but eventually all americans. This is when we changed from colonists to American citizens By the end of the war he is the most popular American.

Spiritually (the soul, no the holy spirit)
 - Believer in republican tradition. Seeks excellence. Maybe the best example of Plato's integrated soul.
 - Believer in commonwealth. Sees corruption in court.

## Video clip: Officers are planning to march on Phillidelphia because they haven't been paid. Washington finds out.
 - Washington was a drama guy, liked plays.
 - Be true to yourself and you won't march on government.

# The constitution

## Hamilton's Plan
 - Unlimited tenure for executive and senate
 - absolute executive veto
 - state governors appointed by central government
 - lower house elected by people, upper house elected by electors

Pretty much the British government

# Virginia Plan
 - Presented by Edmund Randolf, governer of Virginia
 - new constitution, throw out articles of confederation
 - create national executive and national judiciary, executive chosen by legislature
 - create two-house congress power to veto state laws
 - representation apportioned by population (Virginia was huge population wise, they'd get more representation)

Video clip: constitutional convention. Arguments over small vs big states.

# New Jersey Plan
 - small state plan
 - more of a revision of articles of confederation than a totally new constitution
 - on house congress and equal votes for each state
 - congress has power to levy taxes, regulate commerce
 - executive council chosen by Congress, no veto power
 - supreme court with limited jurisdiction
 - congress law takes precedence over state laws

Video clip: Pres. Clinton visits California a lot (23 times) during his first term. Why? Because they have lots of votes. You're there because they matter. He visited Nebraska 1 time in his 8 year presidency. Because Nebraska doesn't matter.

# Compromises
 - facilitated by Benjaman Franklin
 - facilitated by an alliance between large northern states and slave states
 - equality in the senate
 - house of representatives (lower house) is decided by population
 - lower house controlls spending
 - senate (upper house) is equal, 2 senators each
 - slaves counted as 3/5ths of a free person
 - slavery itself was never an issue, it wasn't on the table

# Seperation of Powers (the brilliance of the consitution)

This is where they really seem to get it right.

Three branches:
 - legislative branch (congress, makes the laws)
 - executive branch (president, executes the laws)
 - Judicial branch (court, least developed in the constituion)

Checks and Balances. Each branch has to work with other branches to get things done. They check the ambition of each others.

Legislative branch:

Shared executive powers:
 - overriede vetoes
 - impeaches officials
 - approves treaties and appointments

# The Bill of Rights

Ratified 1789

First 10 ammendments to the constitution

James Madison uses the Bill of Rights as a way to stop a second constitutional convention

## Civil Rights
 - concretely described, carefully limited, made to address real-life situations
 - designed to be pretected in court

## Video Clip
Bill Clinton sex scandal. "Is it true or false that sex happened?" "It depends on the meaning." "Not right now. But it has happened."

## Bill of Rights
 1. freedom of speech, religion, press, assembly, petition
 2. right to militia and to bear arms
 3. no soldiers quartered in houses
 4. no unresasonable search and seizure
 5. due process, double jeopardy. You don't have to testify against yourself.
 6. speedy and public trial
 7. jury trail for civil suits
 8. reasonable bail
 9. Bill of Rights is not 100% inclusive. There are other rights.
 10. powers not delegated to the federal government belongs to the states and the people

# Alexander Hamilton vs Thomas Jefferson
 - What is the role of the government? Created the first political parties.
 - Shaped precedencts that flesh out Constitutuion with tradition and practice
 - determine character of American society

## Video clip: Thomas Jefferson Country Roads
Farming, kid farming with his dad. American farming.

## The republican vision (thomas jefferson):
 - Based on Greek ideas. Good citizens make good societies.d
 - Strong states first, national power second
 - jeffersonian interpreted the constitution strictly. It had to specifically give the federal government rights.
 - sees american people as an agrarian people. farmers are most virtuous.

## Video clip: Alexander Hamilton City Life
Busy New York City. That's where things happen, the best culture. The money, the educated.

## The federalist vision (alexander hamilton)
 - expansion of national power, strong and united, feared in the world
 - wants to urbanize america. promote commercial values and inegrated society. Looks to London, not Athens
 - loose interpretation of constitution. If it doesn't say the federal government can't do it, they can do it.
 - aristocratic leadership, the rich and wellborn. People like him.

## The French Revolution
 - Hamiltonians oppose, distrust big ideas, institutions change but not human nature, virtue is untrustworthy
 - Jeffersonians favor, like power and big ideas, parallels to american revolution, change ehavior through institutions, lead to change & reform

## The "Liberal" Persuasion
 - trust in human virtue
 - quick to embrace ideas and ideologies
 - America is cutting edge of a global revolution to establish justice and human rights
 - root out corruption and reform institutions
 - change is acceptable, and it's how you'll make improvements

## The "Conservatie" Persuasion
 - doublt virtue and appreciae the power of self-interest
 - mistrust new ideas and ideologies
 - cultivate american resect in the world through economic and military power
 - respect established institution and slow on reform


# Exchange Policy

## Economic Approaches
 - Tradition: evolved rules and practices
 - Command: power and autority of government
 - Market: free exchange

## Video clip: stolen parking space, smashes the car in retaliation

## The economic players

Players        | Goals
------------------------------------
|households    | maximize happiness
|business firms| maximize profits
|government    | promote efficiency, equity, and freedom
------------------------------------

## Exchange
 - coordination of coinciding self-interests

## Competitive Free Exchange
 - no party controls terms of exchange
 - must take place in truth and honesty. Good information, no deception.
 - both parties are better off

## Video clip: kid trades stuff for McDonalds, then trades his fries back for his ball. There is a gain, but no product was created.

# Market Weaknesses - WHen bad things happen to good systems

## What Doesn't Work in System
 - official poverty rate 15% or 46.7 million Americans (15.5 million children). That number has been about the same for a while.
 - 1/3 live in poverty at least two months a year
 - 20 million Americans in severe poverty (income below half the poverty line)
 - income inequality. Wealth inequality.

## Analysis of Market Weaknesses

 - Market weakness leads to government intervention, which leads to government control increase.

## Imperfect information
 - Faulty information causes non-mutually beneficial exchanges.

## Video clip: McDonalds commercial

Guys attracted to woman, then they see a kid in a backpack and are no longer attracted. "Dodged a bullet"

## Video clip: McDonalds. Kids want to eat there for the toy. Improper exchange because the kid doesn't really no what he's getting.

## Intervention
 - compensation through judicial system
 - more infortation provided, which helps make better exchanges
 - direct regulation

## Evaluation
 - effective, occasional excesses
 - effective yet costly
 - limits beneficial exchanges

## Externalities

When an exchange effects a third party not involved in the exchange.

Problem
 - We don't account for what happens to the third person

## Video clip: Guy wants to build a second home on his property, but couldn't because it was zoned for agriculture. So he starts farming in protest. That exchange was between the government and the man, but effected all the neighbors because it's unsightly and smelly.

## Externalities

### Intervention
 - Define and enforce property rights
