## Athenian Idea of Virtue

Sought human excellence (arete) in all things, enhanced by proper education.

Plato's cardinal personal virtues:
 - wisdom
 - temperance
 - courage
 - justice

Plato thought if you could make citizens excellent, they would make a good city, and a good city provides what the next generation needs to have good people, and they would in turn improve the city.

## Ancient Christian Virtues

 ex. faith, meekness, humility, kindness, etc.

Those virtues are designed to teach you proper behavior, internally, by changing your heart so you desire to be better. That in turn changes your outward behavior.

In a Christian society, you would seek fairness, and to serve your neighbors.

Problems with Christian virtue:
 - People can take it too far. You can become overzealous.
 - Christians can be too submissive, tune out of society. They're only worried about salvation, not so much making society better.

## Enlightenment Virtue (16, 17, 18th century societies, primarily western europe)

 - Humans act out of self-interest. People do what makes them happy regardless of overall society.
 - Virtue is great, but not reliable
 - Enlightenment thinkers believed what they observed around them
 - People don't inherently care about virtue.

## The Virtues & Vices of Self-Interest
 - it's reliable. If you see $10 on the ground, you'll pick it up.
 - Often people's interests induce cooperation. Aligns self-interest.
 - Other times degenerates into selfishness, self-deception, and narcissism.

Video clip: Mr. Roger's opening song.
 - That show was virtuous.

Video clip: kids dividing candy
 - Kids are asked to take a fair share of candy, and they want to take all of it.
 - They rationalize taking all the candy as fair.

## By the power of self-interest

### Structure:
 - rules and processes designed to promote viruous behavior
 - in government we make structures to do that.

### Counterpoise:
 - balancing one persons' self-interest against another's in a formal, structured relationship

We need both virtue and self-interest for a good society.
