#Battery Ratings
BasicNiCad Cell = 1.25v @ 500 mAH
- Can produce 500 ma for one hour
- 10 mA for 50 hours
- 1000 mA for 30 minutes

Series Voltage Sources
4 x 12v in series = 48v
4 x 12v 60 Ah in series = 60 Ah

In series voltage is additive, current is limited by the smallest in the series.

Parralel Voltage Sources
4 x 12v in parallel = 12v
4 x 12v 60 Ah in parallel = 240 Ah

In parallel voltage is the same, current is additive.
