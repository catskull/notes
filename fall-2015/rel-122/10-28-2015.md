# Jesus Clarifies

Law is fulfilled

Prophets he does not destroy, more to be fulfilled.

Covenant is not fulfilled.

Keep the commandments.

# Other sheep

Voice is used literally.

# Gentile

Gentiles will have the gospel in the latter day.

If they reject, it will be taken away.

If they repent, they will be numbered among the house of israel.

If they don't repent, israel will be victorious over the gentiles.

# Sacrament

If we take the sacrament correctly, we're built on his rock.

# Not taking the sacrament

Don't allow to participate unworthily

Don't know if they will repent, you just give them the opportunity.

You are not an interruption to my life, you are the purpose of it.
