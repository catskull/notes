Focus Text:
When someone dies, we think about their spritual state. "Are they okay?"

v.40 

When someone dies, we suppose they're okay. When we think about someone else's salvation, we start thinking about our own salvation.

Alma puts people in front of their death. "Can you picture yourself clean before God?"

Can repeatedly putting yourself before God weigh on their soul?

Some people carry a microscope on every thing they do, and they feel guilty.

I feel guilty. Forgive yourself. Do we have authority to forgive ourselves?

Someone is not okay with a single sin just because they're righteous.

v39 Have we been redeemed already? If we are in the covenant, yes.
