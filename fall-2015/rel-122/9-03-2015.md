#Alma 30: Korihor

##Context
- Devastating War (Alma 28:1-3, 10-11)
	- So many dead they don't even count them
- Indiscriminate Death (Alma 28:11-14, 29:4-6)
	- Both wicked and righteous die in the war
- Legalism of a Sort (Alma 20: 3-5)
	- Alma 30:3: People kept the God's laws and had continual peace
- Lamanite Mission
	- "Foolish traditions of fathers" arguments used in the mission
	- Korihor uses the same argument against the Nephites

##Frame
- Being without food (Alma 30:2, 56)
	- Fasting and mourning
	- Begins and ends without food
- Death and mourning (Alma 30:2, 59)

##Problems
- The limits of law
	- There was no law against a man's belief
	- Korihor is the symptom of the law
- Knowledge and Belief

##Think about:
- What is it to be religious? To embrace a past or future. To deny religion you must also embrace a past or future, whether you call it a religion or not.
