# Focust Text: Mormon 8: 36-41
Sorrow comes from selfishness which is the opposite of love.
The person that seems offensive is actually being defensive.
Preoccupation with creating a positive self image actually leads to a negative self image.
Those that are puffed up need constantly to be reinflated.
Even service can be selfish.
Something is worth what someone is willing to pay for it.
Jesus has already paid the ultimate price for us and trying to prove that we are is a denial of that fact.
If God be for us, who can be against us?
