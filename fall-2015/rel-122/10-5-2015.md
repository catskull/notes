Helaman 5

Story about a good Dad.

Nephi and Lehi look at what their father spoke to them v.5

"No other success can compensate for failure in the home."

Good fathers have their children do good things. And to do them for the right reasons.

Names his kids after Nephi and Lehi so they will remember his works.
