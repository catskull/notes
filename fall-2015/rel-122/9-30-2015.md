Helaman 1

Paanchi tries to rebel so he can be king.

Why do we hear so much about contention in the BOM?
The point is that the people were destroyed, so that's what he writes about. How that happened.

Helaman 3 may show a turning point in the BOM. Nephite promise stops there (keep commandments and prosper) and shifts more towards the pride cycle.

Objective 2
What's important with conversion is sincerity, not time.

Objective 3
Tobe justified, live the doctrine of christ.

To be sanctified, you must be cleansed from sin.

#Focus Text

What's the worst sin you could commit. Is that a valid question?

The lord can't look upon sin with the least degree of allowance.

Doing things in secret was the beginning of the end.

"The worst sin is the one you think you can get away with."
