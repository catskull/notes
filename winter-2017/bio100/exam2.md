Two types of cells
 - prokaryotic (bacteria), no organized nucleus, pretty simple structure
 - eukaryotic (plants and animals), have a nucleus, cell wall

eukaryotic cells are thought to have been a big cell that "ate" a smaller cell, and they both lived in the same cell

Any tiny mutation can casue the whole cell to mutate. Caused by DNA.

# DNA

Holds instructions for making proteins, passes instructions onto the next generation.

Cutting a tail off a mouse will not make it's successors' tails smaller.

Physical changes do not change DNA.

Fred Griffith Experiment - material of inheritance is independent of life

Oswald Avery Experiment - you can inactivate anything but the DNA. DNA is not alive.

DNA is just a molecule, it's not alive. DNA is the molecule the carries the information from generation to generation, you can move it from one organism to another.

Rosalind Franklin did an x-ray of dna. Watson and Crick did a model of DNA and won the Nobel prize.

Nucleotide - sugar, phosphate and a base. ACTG.

The nitrogen bond is very weak, but thousands together are strong.

5-3, 3-5 - It matters!

One cell's dna is 6'8" long

DNA in just your blood would stretch 50,000 miles

DNA is "spooled" around histones. 60,000 spools in each cell.

DNA has two states: condensed and disperesed. If it's not needed it's wound up very tight so it doesn't take up space.

When a cell replicates, it has to be 100% perfect. If there is a mistake it can cause birth defects or cancer.

DNA helicase - unzip dna

DNA Polymerase - makes the new strand if it sees a mistake it will back up and fix it. HIV doesn't do that.

DNA ligase - glues nicks or cuts back togehter

DNA topoisomerase - prevents supercoiling or over winding

This all happens hundreds of times a second

DNA is made in a 5 to 3, it's read from 3 to 5

single strand dna is unstable

you need a primer to copy dna

okazawi fragments fill in the gaps

DNA primase starts so the polymarase can start

1000 nucleotides per second

50 to 70 billion cells die every day, so that many new cells are created each day

## Human Genome Project

identifying nucleotides and their order

What is a Genome? all DNA in an organism, including all it's genes. There is DNA that is NOT part of genes.

Genes carry information required to make proteins.

Why is a genome important?

Beginning and end of DNA is unique, but the middle is repetitive. The repition varies from person to person.

A challenge of studying DNA is that you'd have to keep getting more DNA to test.

**Kerry Mullis** figured out how to replicate small DNA sequences in a test tube. Super weird guy.

You need primers to start copying DNA.

Polymerase Chain Reaction

in about an hour you can go from 1 copy of dna to a billion

20 types of amino acids

amino acids are the building blocks of protiens

three forms of RNA
 - messenger
 - transfer
 - ribosomal

# Protein

Composed of amino acids

all are the same except the r group

essential amino acids are the ones you can't make yourself

melamine can fool protein tests because they have hydrogen, but melamine is poisonous 

when making a protein chain the byproduct is water

primary structure is just a chain formed by peptide bonds

tertiary structure is when the proteins fold around each other

sickle cell anemia is one amino acid that's out of place, causing it to not fold up correctly

proteins can be "smashed" the shape is changed by:
 - temperature
 - pH
 - chemicals

enzymes change other molecules

# Carbohydrates (sugars)

they have carbons, oxygen and hydrogen C6 H12 O6

sugars built into different shapes make different things: a potato vs cellery

making bonds takes energy, breaking bonds releases energy

ATP adensosine triphosphate

ATP is the currencty of energy. You earn it by eating it, plants earn it by making it (photsynthesis).

*How is it that wood is made out of air* plants capture carbon dioxide out of the air, it converts it into the cellulose

Biological Catalyst (Enzyme)

ezymes can combine substrates, or break them apart

Metabolic Pathways

enzymes add a reactant and pass it along, and the end product is a really complicated product

*Why do leaves change color?* Chlorophyll is green, but in fall it breaks down so the carentonoids (orange) and anthocyanins (red) to show colors that have always been there, but you couldn't see them till the chlorophyl broke down

oranges are there all year, reds don't come till later

factors such as fall weather and how wet it was in the summer can effect how bright the fall colors are

anthocyanins are thought to protect from UV radiation

## Photosynthesis

Two major processes in photosynthesis:
 - light driven reaction: harnesses engergy from the sun
 - carbon fixation reaction: using the energy to make sugar

Glucose Metabolism converts the sugar into energy - exact opposite as photosynthesis

Energy stores:
 - glucose
 - glycogen
 - fat
 - muscle

# Hormones

## Objectives
 - understand what a hormone is
 - understand how glucose levels in the body are regulated
 - understand the diff bewtween type 1 and 2 diabetes

a hormone is released into the blood stream to send a message to another part of the body

steroid hormones go through the cell wall

peptide hormones bind the protein receptors on the cell wall

insulin tells the liver to take glucose and build it into glycogen

glucagon tells the liver to break down glycogen into glucose
