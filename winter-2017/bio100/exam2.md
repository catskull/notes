Two types of cells
 - prokaryotic (bacteria), no organized nucleus, pretty simple structure
 - eukaryotic (plants and animals), have a nucleus, cell wall

eukaryotic cells are thought to have been a big cell that "ate" a smaller cell, and they both lived in the same cell

Any tiny mutation can casue the whole cell to mutate. Caused by DNA.

# DNA

Holds instructions for making proteins, passes instructions onto the next generation.

Cutting a tail off a mouse will not make it's successors' tails smaller.

Physical changes do not change DNA.

Fred Griffith Experiment - material of inheritance is independent of life

Oswald Avery Experiment - you can inactivate anything but the DNA. DNA is not alive.

DNA is just a molecule, it's not alive. DNA is the molecule the carries the information from generation to generation, you can move it from one organism to another.

Rosalind Franklin did an x-ray of dna. Watson and Crick did a model of DNA and won the Nobel prize.

Nucleotide - sugar, phosphate and a base. ACTG.

The nitrogen bond is very weak, but thousands together are strong.

5-3, 3-5 - It matters!

One cell's dna is 6'8" long
