# Gene Expression

mature cells only express a small portion of their DNA

barr body - inactivated x chromisome

a chimera is when  a cell expresses some of it's x chromesomes from mom and some from dad - calico cat

A calico cat is caused by chromesome 23 where they both say what color the skin should be and they're kind of randomly selected.

# Non-coding DNA

About 98% of DNA in humans doesn't code for a gene.

Chromesomes have "caps" that are non coding dna.

A transcription factor help RNA polymerase know where to bind

# Embryonic Development

mRNA are produced in large amounts in an egg, they are transcription factors to help the organism actual start forming

the distribution of the mRNA in divided cells is not uniform, some cells will have different mRNA

Accutante is a retinoids. Retinoids control gene expression in development.

Girls get an X chromesome from mom and and X from dad. Equal parts.

Boys get an x from mom and a y from dad. The Y is smaller so a boy is more like his mom than his dad.

A sperm does not transfer any mitochondira to the egg. Only DNA! All mitochondria is from your mom.

# Evolution

Change in the traits of a population of organisms over generations. Cuased by frequencies of alleles in that population.

Allele: differnet forms of a gene

Eye color is a trait caused by alleles. If people with blue eyes were less fit, you'd see less blue eyed people.

Thomas Malthus - unchecked growth in a population leads to increased competition for food and survival

Charles Lyell - earth is much older than previously thought

Charles Darwin - sailed around the earth. Collected organisms.

Alfred Russell Wallace - came up with many of Darwin's ideas about the same time, but wasn't rich so he didn't get attention

Darwin's observations
 - each region has distinctive style of life forms
 - compared fossils and could piece together evolutions
 - earth is **not** unchanging

Common descent, every organism evolved from the same common ancestor

Natural selection changes traits in populations, not individuals!

Micro evolution are tiny changes, such as the difference between siblings.

Nautral selection finds the balance between advantages and disadvantages of having some genes.

Natural selection is driven by **random** mutations.

Types of natural selection
 - directional selection
  - things get bigger/smaller
 - stabalizing selection
  - everything is normalized
 - disruptive selection
  - a species splits into two sub species from selection (large bird beaks vs small)

# what is a species?

It's a way to categorize things

Homo is genus, sapien is species

No evolutionary biologist believes that humans evolved from monkeys. They believe that we came from a common ancestor.

# Same sex attraction

Attraction: which gender are you attracted to

Behavior: which gender do you have sex with

Identity: how do you identify yourself

Kinsey scale: 0 exclusively heterosexual, 6 exclusively homosexual

# infectious diseases

humans have 10x more bacteria cells than human cells

the very biggest bacteria cells get as big as the smallest human cells

strep throat

streptococcus pyogenes (give you a fever)

treatment is penicillin

if you don't get strep throat treated it can turn into rheumatic fever (an autoimmune disease) and can damage your heart, joints, and brain

# tuberculosis

about 1/3 of all people on earth have tuberculosis. about one person per second gets tuberculosis

it's a lung disease

you have to take antibiotics for 6 months to fight it. If you stop medication you can get antibiotic resistant tb strains.

# virul infections

it's not alive. It uses your body to reproduce.

# Virus life cycle

enter a cell, use the cell machinery, replicate, and destroy the cell in the process

# common cold

rhinovirus (common cold)

some studies think zinc can help

vitamin C hasn't been proven to have any real effect

# Flu (influenza)

Doesn't make you throw up, it's a respritory virus.

Kills more people more than HIV

a flu vaccine is made of dead flu virus

we can grow the flu virus in eggs

# Measles

the leading cause of preventable death worldwide

lds church has donated over $3,000,000 to help vaccinate children

one of the most contagious diseases known

# Parasites

mosquitos are a parasite and are the most dangerous animal in the world
