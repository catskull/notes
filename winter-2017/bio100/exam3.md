# Gene Expression

mature cells only express a small portion of their DNA

barr body - inactivated x chromisome

a chimera is when  a cell expresses some of it's x chromesomes from mom and some from dad - calico cat

A calico cat is caused by chromesome 23 where they both say what color the skin should be and they're kind of randomly selected.

# Non-coding DNA

About 98% of DNA in humans doesn't code for a gene.

Chromesomes have "caps" that are non coding dna.

A transcription factor help RNA polymerase know where to bind

# Embryonic Development

mRNA are produced in large amounts in an egg, they are transcription factors to help the organism actual start forming

the distribution of the mRNA in divided cells is not uniform, some cells will have different mRNA
