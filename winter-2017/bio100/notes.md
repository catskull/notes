Science is a way to answer questions about the world around us. Art, mucis, philosphy , literateure, ethics, and religion are also ways that people ask questions and look for truth.

Ideas must be testable to see if they are correct.

To test things you must accept that the natural world is independent from a persons beliefs.

You have to have observable, experimental and measureable evidence.

You have to look at where the research comes from (tobacco industry research on tobacco safety).

Peer review on research.
