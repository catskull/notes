Mallard Ducks - dabbling ducks

Dabbling ducks don't dive, but can kind of jump out of water. 

Diving ducks need a "runway" to get airborne. Some diving ducks can't even fly unless they start on water.

The prettiest duck in america is a wood duck. They nest in trees.

Four themes in biology:

 - Emergent properties. Complex things happen when simple tings interact.

 - Unity and diversity. A bacteria and an elephant both pass on dna to the next generation.

 - Evolution. Things chnage to adapt to their environment.

 - Scientific process. How do we know stuff.

What does it mean to be alive? 

 - living things control their internal environment
 - living things respond and interact (move)
 - living things use energy
 - living things pass instructions and reproduce (dna)

a cell is the smallest unit if life, surrounded by a cell membrane

levels of organation
 - atoms (smallest)
 - molecules
 - organelles
 - cells
 - organs
 - organizations together is a population

Science is a way to answer questions about the world around us. Art, mucis, philosphy , literateure, ethics, and religion are also ways that people ask questions and look for truth.

Ideas must be testable to see if they are correct.

To test things you must accept that the natural world is independent from a persons beliefs.

You have to have observable, experimental and measureable evidence.

You have to look at where the research comes from (tobacco industry research on tobacco safety).

Peer review on research.

"People can be entitled to their own opinions, but they are not entitled to their own facts." - Steven Chu

Scientific facts don't change, but our interpretations do.

Important scientific questions are extremely complex, and often difficult to interpret.

A simple answer to a complex problem is probably naive or misleading.

Romans dying of "bad air" (malaria), they concluded the swamp air must be killing them.

In science, they never prove anything. They fail to disprove things.

A scientific theory is based off many hypothesis that are not disproven. After years of testing and research, a theory may become a law.


# Cancer

Abnormal growth is not cancer, but cancer is an abnormal growth. A growth of individual cells.

Two tumors:
 - benign tumor: cells confined to the tissue where they started. They don't move.
 - malignant tumor: cells from the tumor metastasize or travel to other parts of the body and start new tumors

All cancers involve DNA. Very few cancers are inherited.

Cancer is caused when DNA mutates (by radiation or other things).

Cancer cells are not mature or fully functional. Lukemia is proliferation of white blood cells, but they don't help you fight infection.

Cancer cells secrete **angiogenic** factors that stimulate blood vessel growth into the cancer to allow it to grow and survive.

Many potential cancers don't produce angiogenic factors and never really grow enough to notice.

Your immune system can kill cancer.

**Apoptosis** programmed cell death. "Ugly" caterpiller cells die so it can become a butterfly.

Cancer can come from cells that grow faster, or cells that die too slowly.

**Metastasize** the ability of a cell to adhere.

Different genes in your body can cause or prevent cancers.

Oncogenes are genes which promote cell growth and reproduction.

Tumor suppressor genes are genes which inhibit cell division and survival.
