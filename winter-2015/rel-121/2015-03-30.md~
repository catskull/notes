##Competing Religious Views - Priests of Noah vs Abinadi
How am I saved? Priests of Noah say the law of Moses. Abinadi says the Law of Christ.

Abinadi gets into trouble because he calls the king wicked. He's also preaching atonemnet and repentance. He tells of famine if they don't repent. Priests of Noah claim that because they're prospering, they must be keeping the commandments.

Priests of Noah test Abinadi by quoting Isaiah 52.
 - Why start here? This is saying if you're from God, you'll bring forth good tidings. Abinadi is bringing bad tidings, he's calling them to repentance.
Abinadi says since the beginning the prophets have testified that God himself will come among men. That is also what he's doing. This is good news.

##The Trial of Abinadi - The Doctrine
A root out of dry ground, means he will be from the lineage of David, that the Jews had been in apostasy for quite some time.

##How is Jesus both the Father and the Son?
 1. By Creation. He is the creator of the world, so he is the father of the world.
 2. Father through Spiritual Birth. We obtain salvation only througha  covenant with him, Chris is our "spritual" father or the father of our salvation.
 3. Father by Divine Ivestiture. He has the authority to speak as if he is his father.
