#Linear feedback shift registers (LFSR)
##Random -- what does that really mean?
 - Deep meteaphysical question (what _is_ random?)
 - Don't trust your intuition!
   * our brain is a pattern-matching beast!
 - Test rendomness with statistical tests
 - True randomness only comes from non-deterministic processes
  * Typically nature

"Anyone who considers arithmetical methods of producting random digits is, of course, in a state of sin"
  John von Neumann

###Pseudo-random -- appears to be random
 - Passes statistical tests
 - But is completely deterministic and casual
 - Much easier to do than truly random
 - Repeatability is good for testing
 - But may be easily predictable

###Fibbonachi vs Glaios
Galois is better in hardware because xors are parrallel instead of series

Galois also better in software.
```(lfsr >> 1) & (-(lfsr & 1u) & (pattern of bits));```

###Using LFSRs responsibly
 - The lower-order bit is a nice pseudo-random stream
 - More than one bit is **not** -- statistical tests fail miserably

###Actual uses of LFSRs
 - Test pattern generation
 - Avoiding repeated patterns in communication
  * digitial television in North America
  * CDMA (cell phones)
  * Wifi
  * USB
 - Jamming systems (to generate noise)
 - Cryptography (GSM cell phones, Bluetooth)
