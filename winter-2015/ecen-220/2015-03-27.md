#Processor Execution
##THe Von Neumann Model
Fetch, execute, and repeat.

##LC-3
###Common Data Bus
Needs a tri state driver
 - Can drive 1's and 0's on the bus
 - Can disconnect from the bus
 - Symbol is a triangle with a wire (enable) coming out the side
 - Control unit turns them on and off

###Registers
 - 8x16 general purpose registers
 - Two read address ports
 - One write address port
 - Control unit generates control and address signals
  - To read register file
  - To write back into the register file

###Instruction Register (IR)
 - During a fetch the IR is loaded from the bus
 - Control unit controls when it should be loaded
 - It's fields are pulled apart and fed to many place in the circuit
  - op code
  - source/destination registers
  - immediate data
  - offests

###ALU
 - It is _always_ working, results are only stored away at the right time
 - One input always comes from the register file
 - Second input has two sources
  - register file
  - imm5 from instruction (sign extended)
 - Bit 5 of IR selects 2nd input
 - Control unit tells ALU which operation to perform

###EAB (effective address block)
 - Calculates effective addresses for the MAR and the PC
 - It adds operands that are selected by the control unit
 - ONe operand is zero or a sign extended filed from the IR
 - The other operand is the current value of the PC or the contents of a register from the register file
 - The sum is passed to botht he PCMUX and the MARMUX as an effective address

###PC and PCMUX
 - Can be a PC+1
 - Can come from global bus
 - Can come from EAB

###MARMUX
 - The marmux seleccts what addres is driven onto global bus for loading into the MAR
 - Can be IR[7:0] zero extended (for TRAP instructions)

###N, Z, P Condition Codes
