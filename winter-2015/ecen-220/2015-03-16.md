#Debouncers

A finite state machine that can convert a 'noisey' signal into a clear signal. Have a counter that counts from when the noisey signal goes high, and waits for the signal to go stable, then wait a certain time.

Noisy input is asynchronous. Very small pulses may be missed by the FSM.

You can synchronize the noisy signal by adding a flop to it. To further synchronize it, have an enable signal on the flop that only enables it every n clock cycles (add a FSM counter that's true every n clock cycles).

For a timer, write the synchronizer using a mux, but the tools will probably generate a simple and gate.

Have the output of your timer be a meeley output tied to the carry out of the adder. That means that all the inputs to the counter were 1's and it's rolling over.

We can build the counter with only half adders using carry out and one input. Basically this just adds two inputs. The carry in to the counter will always be a 1 (giving us the +1).

## Summary

Debouncer is a timer and a FSM

Async input 'noisey' means we need to make sure our system works with any inputs.
